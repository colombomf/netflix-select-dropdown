# Netflix Language Select Menu
Styling select menus can be challenging depending on the level of customization required but adding details can also add that extra touch of polish and make your project stand out!

I've noticed that Netflix clones often do not include a language select menu with both icons, so I decided to try implementing it myself.  

This is not a Netflix clone. Rather, it is my own version of the Netflix language select menu that you can utilize for your projects.
